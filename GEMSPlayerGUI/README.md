when you unpack GEMS banks with splitter - it creates a hundreds folders 000, 001, 002,... - it is slots of GEMS Sequences bank. then you can launch GUI - it can play this unpacked tracks. player is create some virtual GEMS banks with only onle slot - that was clicked and play. it used GEMS Play dll by Sharpnull(Infval). 

source code i can add later if it need. with example of import and creating banks in a memory.

to recreate whole slots into big GEMS banks - can be used r57shell's combaine. i can attach it with .bat file example of using. after this, when new modified banks will be created - they can be inserted into a game. just to the end of rom and need a fix place, where was original addresses to new one. (everything of this can be made with Multi GEMS)

so idea is - Deflemask will be convert songs into this unpacked version of song, not directly into a GEMS banks. i mean into some 000, 001, 002,... folder, wich user choice. only then rebuild banks by combaine for future using in a game.
